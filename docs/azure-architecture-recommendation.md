# Recommended Azure Architecture for Cannasol BOM Generator

## Cost-Optimized Architecture (Under $50/month total)

### Frontend: Azure Static Web Apps (FREE)
- Host your React app
- Built-in CI/CD from GitHub
- Custom domains included
- SSL certificates automatic

### Backend API: Azure Container Apps ($5-15/month)
- Host your Python FastAPI
- Scales to zero when not used
- Much cheaper than Azure Functions for APIs
- Better performance for database connections

### Database: Azure SQL Database Serverless ($5-25/month)
- Auto-pause when not used
- Pay only for what you use
- Built-in backups and security
- Perfect for small business workloads

### Total Monthly Cost: $10-40/month

## Alternative: All-Free Architecture

### Frontend: Azure Static Web Apps (FREE)
- Same as above

### Backend: Azure Static Web Apps API (FREE)
- Use built-in API functions
- 500MB bandwidth/month (plenty for BOM data)
- Automatic scaling

### Database: Azure SQL Database Free Tier
- 32GB storage (sufficient for BOM data)
- 1 DTU (fine for small workloads)

### Total Monthly Cost: $0

## Implementation Steps

1. **Start with All-Free Architecture**
2. **Monitor usage and performance** 
3. **Upgrade to Container Apps only if needed**
4. **Scale database as data grows**

## Why This Beats Azure Functions

| Aspect | Azure Functions | Container Apps | Static Web Apps API |
|--------|----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Cold Start | 2-5 seconds | 1-2 seconds | <1 second |
| Database Connections | Limited pool | Full control | Limited but sufficient |
| Cost (low traffic) | $0-20/month | $5-15/month | $0 |
| Development | Complex setup | Standard FastAPI | Simple functions |
| Monitoring | Good | Excellent | Basic |

## Recommended: Start with Azure Static Web Apps + API

This gives you:
- ✅ Zero cost to start
- ✅ Easy development workflow
- ✅ Built-in authentication
- ✅ Automatic HTTPS
- ✅ Global CDN
- ✅ Perfect for BOM data volume

You can always migrate to Container Apps later if you need more power!
